# putting-data-on-the-web

The following _Jupyter Notebooks_ provide an quick introduction to creating some simple visualisations that can be embeded on websites. All visualisations rely on _Python_ plus a few libraries which provied quick and easy ways to generate HTML/Javascript/images to embed on websites.


## Example _Notebooks_

### Mapping Data

Example maps are generated using the Python [Folium](http://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) library. This allows you to quickly and easily generate maps based on the powerful [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) library.

## Previewing and sharing notebooks

Notebooks can be previewed, but not modified, using https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
The serice accepts a github urls to files an renders an interacitive version of the last saved state of the notebook.

The previews in the tables above use this service.


## Running the _Notebooks_

Microsoft currently provides a free service which allows you to run a _Jupyter Notebook_ on the Azure Cloud. It is currently the easiest way to use _Jupyter Notebooks_ without installing it locally on your own machine.

http://notebooks.azure.com

All examples in this repository can be uploaded the the http://notebooks.azure.com and run with minimal modification.

NOTE: Changes relate to download locations as microsoft limits the sites it allows to download from. Notes on changes appear as comments in the example notebooks in thsi repository.
